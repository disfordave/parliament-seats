# 🏛️ Parliament Seats

[![Parliament Seats Mockup](docs/images/parliament-seats-mockup.jpg)](https://parliame.com)

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://parliame.com](https://parliame.com)

Parliament Seats is an interactive **coalition simulator and parliamentary seat visualizer** inspired by election-night graphics used in television broadcasts.

Many election visualizations show seat distributions for a single election. Parliament Seats generalizes that idea into a reusable tool where users can explore **different parliamentary systems, party configurations, and coalition scenarios** across multiple countries.

The application allows users to experiment with political party configurations and instantly see how seat distributions translate into potential governing coalitions.

# Why This Project Exists

Election broadcasts often include beautiful interactive graphics showing how seats are distributed in a parliament and which coalitions might form a government.

However, these tools are usually tied to **a specific election and dataset**.

Parliament Seats was created to make that experience reusable:

- explore different parliamentary systems
- test hypothetical election outcomes
- experiment with coalition combinations
- visualize how seat distributions affect governing majorities

---

# Features

## Coalition Simulation

Select political parties and instantly see whether they reach a governing majority.

Seat totals and majority thresholds update in real time as parties are selected.

---

## Tie-Breaker Logic

Supports parliamentary systems where a **tie-breaking vote** may determine the outcome (e.g. the US Senate model).

Tie-breaking is treated as a **vote outcome rule**, not as an additional seat.

---

## Multi-Country Support

Includes sample parliamentary structures such as:

- European Union
- Germany (Bundestag)
- Austria (Nationalrat)
- Netherlands (Tweede Kamer)
- Belgium (Kamer / Chambre)
- United Kingdom (House of Commons)
- South Africa (National Assembly)
- Australia (Senate and House)
- Canada (House of Commons / Chambre des communes)
- France (Assemblée nationale)
- New Zealand (House of Representatives)

Users can also create custom parliament configurations.

---

## Political Spectrum Visualization

Parties can be sorted and displayed according to their **political positioning** (left → center → right), allowing users to visualize ideological balance within coalitions.

---

## Interactive Seat Visualization

Seat distributions are displayed using:

- horizontal bar charts for seat counts
- pie charts for seat distribution
- majority threshold indicators

Visualizations update instantly when party data changes.

---

## Scenario Import / Export

Parliament configurations can be saved and shared using **JSON import/export**.

This allows users to:

- store custom scenarios
- recreate hypothetical elections
- share configurations with others

---

## Multilingual Interface

The application currently supports:

- English
- German (Deutsch)
- French (Français)
- Dutch (Nederlands)

Language can be changed using the `?lang=` URL parameter.

---

## Responsive Design

Parliament Seats works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

The visualization layout adapts automatically to different screen sizes.
